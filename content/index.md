In 2023, I turned 50! Time to chase a dream. I've always been drawn to the world of Business Intelligence (BI). In 2020/2021, I took a big step towards this dream by completing an extensive program in data science. It really prepared me for what was to come.

And now, I've made the move. After spending 27 years in controlling, with some time spent on web design projects on the side, I've taken the leap. I accepted a job as a BI specialist and have been working at it  since the summer of 2023. Power BI is my main tool, and there's so much I'm excited to learn. It's a big change, but it's exactly what I've been aiming for. 

Inspired by [Nicole van der Hoeven](https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/), I've decided to publish my notes online, embracing the concept of "learning in public." As a dedicated user of Obsidian, I was immediately sold on the idea when Nicole released a very clear video explaining how Quartz can serve as a bridge between markup notes and GitHub. Many thanks to Jacky Zhao for making Quartz!

You can find the documentation for Quartz here: [https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/build](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/build)
