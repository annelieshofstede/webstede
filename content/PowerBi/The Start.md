Inspired by Nicole van der Hoeven, I've decided to publish my Obsidian Notes online, embracing the concept of "learning in public." As a dedicated user of Obsidian, I was immediately sold on the idea when Nicole released a very clear video explaining how Quartz can serve as a bridge between markup notes and GitHub. Many thanks to Jacky Zhao for making Quartz!

You can find the documentation for Quartz here: [https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/build](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/build) Nicole's explanatory video here:
