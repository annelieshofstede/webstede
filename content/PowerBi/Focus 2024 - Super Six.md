Feeling overwhelmed by everything there is to learn about Power BI, I came across Brian Julius in February 2024: Super Six topics to learn Power BI in GetResponsive Live GRL episode 162. My learning plan and focus for the coming year will be on these six points. Thanks a lot, Brian, for supporting this focus and Jeroen for bringing this to me in an GRL episode.
